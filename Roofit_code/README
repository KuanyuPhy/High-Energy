This fitting tutorial, shown at BAS 2012-05-10, is supposed to give an
introduction to the usage of RooFit. Beside the basic usage, it also provides
an example how to use libRooComplexPDF, an extension designed to deal with
complex PDFs e.g. in Dalitz analysis, amplitude analysis or just fitting a 
relativistic BW. It also covers libRooTatami, a wrapper class to do time-
dependent fits within RooFit.

- README:
	This file

- doc:
	Contains talks and other further documentation about RooFit. All contents
	can in principle found be on public webpages.

- examples:
	Contains a collection of examples for different problems.

- exercises:
	Contains the source code for the individual exercises.

- lib:
	This folder is generated during compilation and contains, in case of success,
	all the compiled shared libraries.

- libCacheIntegrator:
	Source code of libCacheIntegrator (see Jeju BAS in Okt 2011 for some information
	on that). It can help you to speed up numeric integrations.

- libComplexPDF:
	Source code of libComplexPDF. This library contains all the lineshapes etc...

- libRooComplexPDF:
	Source code of libRooComplexPDF. This library contains wrappers to libComplexPDF, such
	that the lineshapes can be used in RooFit. It also contains some other PDFs that might
	be useful. 

- libRooTatami:
	Source code of libRooTatami.

- tuples:
	Contains some tuples used during the examples:
	- toymc_basic.root
		The data file for the basic example
	- toymc_dalitz.root
		The data file for the Dalitz example

setup_exercises.bash/csh
	Script to setup a folder "worksheet" which contains all the exercises and Makefiles and should be edited
	instead of the original exercises folder

setup_environment_kekcc.bash/csh
	Source the script to setup the environment on KEKCC computers
